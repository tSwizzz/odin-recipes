        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I will be showing you all the ingredients and step by step process on how to bake this delicious cake. Let us begin.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Flour</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Sugar</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Milk</li>
                <li>Baking Soda</li>
                <li>Chocolate powder</li>
                <li>Chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat two 9-inch-round cake pans with cooking spray and line the bottoms with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk the cocoa powder and 1 1/2 cups boiling water in a medium bowl until smooth; set aside. Whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl until combined. Add the eggs, vegetable oil, sour cream and vanilla and beat with a mixer on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the cocoa mixture in a steady stream until just combined, then finish mixing with a rubber spatula. (The batter will be thin.)</li>
            <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans and tap the pans against the counter to help the batter settle. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.</li>
